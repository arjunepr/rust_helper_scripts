# Rust Helper Scripts

A collection of Rust scripts that I make and use for convenience. What I do, is have the relevant bits of bash code be inserted into my .bashrc file. For files like rustfmt.general.toml, I place them in the home directory of my default user profile, where my bash functions may expect to find these pieces.

Feel free to suggest more utility code for me to add to this repo - I'll be glad to have more things that add to convenience :)
